    <p>This is a guide for how to make oatmeal on the stovetop and in 
        the microwave, plus four ways to customize. 
        It's a heart-healthy easy staple breakfast recipe</p>
    <p>I share my bowl of oatmeal often on Instagram and 
        Snapchat and I always get questions about how to make oatmeal. 
        So here’s how to make this easy staple recipe. And you’ll never wonder again 
        what to have for a healthy breakfast!
        What I love about oatmeal is that it’s really <strong>quick and easy to make</strong>, <strong>you can 
        customize it</strong> with any toppings, and it <em>keeps you full with lots of energy</em> to last 
        your morning! And I love that routine in my morning to have something consistent 
        that I know will make my body feel good.</p> 
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Quick Oats:</strong> These are more fine oats that can be cooked really quickly. 
            You can certainly use those, but I don’t recommend them because they are 
            more processed in general and only save you an extra minute of cooking time.</li>
        <li><strong>Steel Cut Oats:</strong> This is the whole oat, unrolled and unprocessed type. These take the 
            longest time to cook, and need at least 20 minutes on the stovetop</li>
        <li><strong>Old Fashioned Oats or Rolled Oats:</strong> In between the quick oats and steel cut oats, 
            you’ll find old fashioned or rolled oats. They are pretty similar, but the rolled ones 
            are slightly rolled/pressed, which makes them more processed. These are thicker than 
            quick oats, so they need more time to cook. Either old fashioned oats or rolled oats 
            work great for this recipe.</li>
        
    </ul> 
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <p><li>Start by measuring the oats and liquids: 
            The usual serving size is ½ cup oats to 1 cup of water, milk or combination of both.
        </li></p>
        <p><li>Then place in the microwave without a cover on it.
            Microwave on high for 2 minutes and the consistency should be perfect.
        
        </li></p>
        <h2>Topping</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Maple Brown Sugar:</strong> This is a classic flavor most oatmeal packets come in.
             But the homemade maple brown sugar is so much better. I make it with brown sugar, maple syrup, pecans and cinnamon.

            </li>
            <li><strong>Strawberry & Cream:</strong> This is such a dreamy yummy combination. Just add fresh sliced strawberries, a splash of half and half or coconut cream or any non-dairy creamer, along with some honey and a touch of vanilla extract.</li>
            <li><strong>Chocolate Peanut Butter:</strong>This one’s for the kiddos. And who am I kidding, sometimes for me too! When the oatmeal is still warm, I stir in cocoa or cacao powder and keep stirring until the mixture looks chocolatey. Then embellish the chocolate taste with chocolate chips, and add a spoon of peanut butter along with crunchy peanuts on top. My kids devour this, and it’s a bit on the indulgent side of healthy, but nonetheless still good for you.</li>
            <li><strong>Banana Nut:</strong> This is another one of the classic oatmeal flavors that comes in a packet, so I love recreating it with actual fresh bananas (not the taste of bananas). I usually slice half a banana and add walnuts, ground flaxseeds and cinnamon.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
