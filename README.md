# project-recipe
This is my first real project using HTML. In this project, I will put all my knowledge and what I learn so far in a basic recipe website.

Perhaps as a first run, this will not look like a pro website, but I will revisit this project in the future to update and apply new things as I progress throughout the courses that I'm doing.
